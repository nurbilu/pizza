"# pizza" 
This website is for a family-owned pizzeria that has been serving up delicious pizzas for over 20 years. 
We use only the freshest ingredients, and our pizzas are made to order.

We're proud to be a part of the community, and we love to give back. We donate a portion of our proceeds to local charities, and we offer free pizza to firefighters and police officers on their birthdays.

We hope you'll come in and try our pizza soon!
